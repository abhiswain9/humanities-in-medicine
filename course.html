          <p>The enterprise of medicine affects human life and values in ways, which cannot be foreseen, even by those most intimately involved. Thus clinical medicine is at its foundation a moral enterprise. While ethical discourse is one means to investigate and describe this enterprise, clinical medicine is far too complex to be reduced to scientific, ethical, or any other specialized language. Therefore narrative, as “simple” as story telling can be a potent tool in learning and studying the events in the clinical arena. Narrative may take many forms and drama has much to offer as a way to both learn and investigate human problems and interaction in the clinical arena.</p>
          <p>It is a truism to state that there are complex relationships involved in the interaction between patient and physician, however successful communication is a critical building block for the physician patient relationship. Communication depends on many skills and knowledge bases, including verbal skills, body language, story telling, ethical discourse, and understanding of the “self” and “the other”. Developing and improving these skills is critical throughout the career of a “healer”.</p>
          <p>In this selective the students will interact with theatre professionals in short dramas that are centered about medical themes. The goals will be to achieve a level of performance of the drama as well as an understanding of the issues portrayed. Importantly the students will learn how to effectively convey emotion and information in a manner most likely to be received by patients. </p>
          <p>Social and ethical issues are critical in the enterprise of medicine. However they are not separate from the care of the individual patient nor from the interaction of the physician, patient and family </p>
